This is the code site for our recent research "Regional gap in health adaptation to PM2.5 in ageing China drives persistent long-distance medical travels". 

(a) calculating population weighted pm2.5 concentration at city-level for GEMM model;

(b) calculating population weighted gdp at city-level for Gravity model to estimate intercity medical flows;

(c) GEMM model to estimate health burden and intercity medical demands;

(d) Gravity model to estimate the distribution of intercity medical travels and flows.
